********

This is a boilerplate generator that generates code based on the
comments it finds in source code.


Motivation
==========

The motivation is that ordinary boilerplate generators either require
you to hack the build system you're using (to build the source code on
the fly) or you statically generate the boiler plate (and are then
unable to modify it or generate more without pulling together the
script that first generated it).
